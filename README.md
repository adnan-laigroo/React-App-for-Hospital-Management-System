# Hospital Management System - React Frontend

This is the frontend application for the Hospital Management System project. It is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The frontend interacts with the backend API endpoints to provide a seamless user experience for managing hospital activities.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for doctors, receptionists, and administrators to manage hospital activities.
- Real-time updates and notifications for appointment status changes.
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices.
- Seamless integration with the backend API to fetch and update data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the frontend application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org) based on your operating system.

## Getting Started

To run the Hospital Management System frontend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd hospital-management-system-frontend
```
3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```
5. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access the Hospital Management System.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
